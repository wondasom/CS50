< ✨ Internet >

1. IP Address(Internet Protocol Address)
- (IPv4) #.#.#.# 32-bit IP -> four billion possible IP address
- (IPv6) #.#.#.#.#.#  128-bit IP -> 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 possible IP address
- ISP(Internet Service Provider)
- DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) from ISP 
    which is a software that ISPs run and provide to you that allowed your laptop or phone working
- multiple devices? they all need their unique addresses.


2. DNS Server(Domain Name Service Server) from ISP 
- convert domain names to IP addresses  


3. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- to ensure the data to get to the destination
- specific number for a specific service, a port identifier
- ex) 80: HTTP, 443: HTTPS, 25: e-mail etc.


4. UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
- does not guarantee delivery 
- send a request but may/may not get a response
- sometimes when you want the data they keep coming, and keep coming, especially when it's high volume, 
- you don't want to stop and resent data, 
- you want just to ignore it and trust that the users are going to be OK with that.
- ex) live video conferencing, live sporting event


5. Router
- if your IP Address starts with 10 or 192.168 or 172.16, 
- it means they most likely came from a home router, or a business router... (private IP)
- several routers in an entity + several routers in an entity + ... + :networks of networks 
- You can check the hops and the routing process with 'traceroute'


6. Undersea Cables that power the Internet
- The first transatlantic cable was laid in the 1850s to send telegraphs between Newfoundland and Ireland
- There are now over 300 undersea cables stretching 550,000 miles.
- That's enough to circle the earth 22 times
- The longest cable hits 39 landing points from Germany to Korea, spanning 24,000 miles.
- Some are laid over 25,000 ft below the ocean's surface.
- The cables are less than 3 inches thick and house several optical fibers.
- They transmit 99% of all international data.
- Laying one cable across an ocean takes several months & costs hundreds of millions of dollars.


7. Cable Modem, Switch, Home Router... 
- coaxial connection 
- phone jacks
- RJ11
- RJ45, ethernet cable
- Wi-Fi support(wireless)


It is sometimes so easy to ignore the physical foundation under the hood of the magic of the internet..!
