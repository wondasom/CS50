< ✨ Internet >

1. IP Address(Internet Protocol Address)
- (IPv4) #.#.#.# 32-bit IP -> four billion possible IP address
- (IPv6) #.#.#.#.#.#  128-bit IP -> 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 possible IP address
- ISP(Internet Service Provider)
- DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) from ISP 
    which is a software that ISPs run and provide to you that allowed your laptop or phone working
- multiple devices? they all need their unique addresses.


2. DNS Server(Domain Name Service Server) from ISP 
- convert domain names to IP addresses  


3. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- to ensure the data to get to the destination
- specific number for a specific service, a port identifier
- ex) 80: HTTP, 443: HTTPS, 25: e-mail etc.


4. UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
- does not guarantee delivery 
- send a request but may/may not get a response
- sometimes when you want the data they keep coming, and keep coming, especially when it's high volume, 
- you don't want to stop and resent data, 
- you want just to ignore it and trust that the users are going to be OK with that.
- ex) live video conferencing, live sporting event


5. Router
- if your IP Address starts with 10 or 192.168 or 172.16, 
- it means they most likely came from a home router, or a business router... (private IP)
- several routers in an entity + several routers in an entity + ... + :networks of networks 
- You can check the hops and the routing process with 'traceroute'


6. Undersea Cables that power the Internet
- The first transatlantic cable was laid in the 1850s to send telegraphs between Newfoundland and Ireland
- There are now over 300 undersea cables stretching 550,000 miles.
- That's enough to circle the earth 22 times
- The longest cable hits 39 landing points from Germany to Korea, spanning 24,000 miles.
- Some are laid over 25,000 ft below the ocean's surface.
- The cables are less than 3 inches thick and house several optical fibers.
- They transmit 99% of all international data.
- Laying one cable across an ocean takes several months & costs hundreds of millions of dollars.


7. Cable Modem, Switch, Home Router... 
- coaxial connection 
- phone jacks
- RJ11
- RJ45, ethernet cable
- Wi-Fi support(wireless)


8. AN ANALOGY - to understand HTTP Request

It can be tricky to understand how HTTP functions because it’s difficult to examine what your browser is actually doing. 
(And perhaps also because we explained it using acronyms that may be new to you.) 
Let’s review what we learned by using an analogy that could be more familiar to you.

Imagine the internet is a town. You are a client and your address determines where you can be reached. 
Businesses in town, such as Codecademy.com, serve requests that are sent to them. 
The other houses are filled with other clients like you that are making requests and expecting responses from these businesses in town. 
This town also has a crazy fast mail service, an army of mail delivery staff that can travel on trains that move at the speed of light.

Suppose you want to read the morning newspaper. 
In order to retrieve it, you write down what you need in a language called HTTP and ask your local mail delivery staff agent to retrieve it from a specific business. 
The mail delivery person agrees and builds a railroad track (connection) between your house and the business nearly instantly, 
and rides the train car labeled “TCP” to the address of the business you provided.

Upon arriving at the business, she asks the first of several free employees ready to fulfill the request. 
The employee searches for the page of the newspaper that you requested but cannot find it 
and communicates that back to the mail delivery person.

The mail delivery person returns on the light speed train, ripping up the tracks on the way back, 
and tells you that there was a problem “404 Not Found.” 
After you check the spelling of what you had written, you realize that you misspelled the newspaper title. 
You correct it and provide the corrected title to the mail delivery person.

This time the mail delivery person is able to retrieve it from the business. 
You can now read your newspaper in peace until you decide you want to read the next page, 
at which point, you would make another request and give it to the mail delivery person.





It is sometimes so easy to ignore the physical foundation under the hood of the magic of the internet..!
