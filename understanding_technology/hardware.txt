1. Computer and Binary System
- Fundamentally, human and computer count in the same way but computers have 'smaller vocabulary'.
- but WHY?
    because the binary system is more convenient in the physical world, to be able to represent only two states(on/off) instead of 10. 

- to represent number
    ex) human way: 7
        computer way: 1 1 1( = 💡💡💡) 

- to represent letters
    ex) human way: HI
        computer way: 010100 010101 ( = 0💡0💡00 0💡0💡0💡) with ASCII chart or UNICODE etc(even emoji characters!)

- At the end of the day, all the computer is storing is 0s and 1s, 
- but it's up to the ✨program✨ to interpret those 0s and 1s in a certain way.
    ex) if a program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs sees a pattern of bits in a file that represents the decimal number 65-- 
        it's still a pattern of 0s and 1s expressed in binary, but of course, we've seen how we can convert that to decimal. 
        So if a computer is ultimately storing a pattern of 0s and 1s that represents the decimal number 65, the computer, 
        in this case, Microsoft Word, or Google Docs, and the program running there, is going to interpret that pattern, 
        not as the number 65, and not as a whole bunch of 0s and 1s alone, but as the capital letter A.
        It is called mapping numbers to letters.


2. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- 🧠 the brain of the computer
- a whole bunch of golden pins
- connected to motherboard 
- what kind of thinking it does?: to perform math, to display letters, etc
    in the CPU there are one or more cores 


3. Core(s) 
- there is/are core(s) in the CPU
- multiple cores means: it can do multiple things at the same time
- hyperthreading


4. Chip(s)
- other components in the computer
- usually in the iPad etc


5. RAM (Random Access Memory) -❕memory device
- in the motherboard
- it stores data only when it is running (❗️volatile)
- electronic


6. Hard Drive (Hard Disk) -❕memory device
- where the data is stored even when the power is off (⚡️nonvolatile)
- much bigger than RAM
- there is a fan
- mechanical device!
- it uses tiny magnetic particles depending on their orientation up or down, represent a 1 or 0.
    And if you have enough of those particles, 
    you can represent bytes or megabytes or gigabytes or terabytes or more or anything in between. 
    And so you have the ability to store data this way or this way, even when the power is off. 


7.SSD (Solid State Drive) -❕memory device 
- data persist when the power is off (⚡️nonvolatile)
- entirely electronic 
- much faster than a hard drive
- doesn't have a spinning device 


8. hybrid drive -❕memory device 


9. flash drive (portable) -❕memory device 
- solid-state drive (external) (⚡️nonvolatile)
- a.k.a called USB or hard drive


10. ✨Like a Funnel! 
Disk -> RAM (-> L3 cache -> L2 cache -> L1 cache) -> CPU -> Registers 


11. Connectors (a.k.a called Bus)
- various USB types
- why is it important?
    even though you have a super-fast, fancy flash drive, if you have an old, slow connector, the performance can be maximized.


12. WI-FI


13. Bluetooth
- usually connects personal devices


14. operating system
- it's the operating system, ultimately, that is loaded into RAM from disk, and is what you ultimately see. 
    gives the graphical windows that you see and the icons and the buttons that you can click
    knows how to talk to your keyboard and your mouse etc.
    knows how to display information on the screen. 
    knows how to move things around in memory and disk and reading and writing all of that information.
- And that's all thanks to software that comes with an operating system called device drivers-- 
- special software designed to talk to a certain model of printer, to a certain model of camera, or scanner, and the like.
